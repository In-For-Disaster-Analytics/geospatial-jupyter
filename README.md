# Geospatial Analysis Application   

This application provides a Jupyter lab environment with essential geospatial analysis packages preinstalled in order to facilitate work in that space.  

Packages:

[contextily](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
: contextily is a small Python 3 (3.9 and above) package to retrieve tile maps from the internet. It can add those tiles as basemap to matplotlib figures or write tile maps to disk into geospatial raster files. 

[dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/index.html)
: Dask is a Python library for parallel and distributed computing.

[fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
: Filesystem interfaces for PythonÔÉÅ

[Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)
: Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in a Leaflet map via folium.    

[GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/stable/)
: GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing.

[geodatasets](https://geodatasets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
: The geodatasets contains an API on top of a JSON with metadata of externally hosted datasets containing geospatial information useful for illustrative and educational purposes.

[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)
: The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.

[h3-py](https://pypi.org/project/h3/)
: Ptyhon wrapper for Uber's [H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Geospatial Indexing System](https://h3geo.org/) in Python

[Ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
: Ipyleaflet is a Jupyter widget for Leaflet.js , enabling interactive maps in the Jupyter notebook. Every object in ipyleaflet (including the Map, TileLayers, Layers, Controls, etc.) is interactive: you can dynamically update attributes from Python or from the browser.

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 

[plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
: Interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python

[proj](https://proj.org/)
: PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software, that transforms coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations

[pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html)
: Apache Arrow Python bindings

[observable_jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/observable-jupyter/)
:  Embed cells from Observable notebooks into Jupyter notebooks.  

[rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
:  Geographic information systems use GeoTIFF and other formats to organize and store gridded raster datasets such as satellite imagery and terrain models. Rasterio reads and writes these formats and provides a Python API based on Numpy N-dimensional arrays and GeoJSON.  

[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
: *scikit-image* is a collection of algorithms for image processing.

[s3fs](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
: Pythonic file interface to S3.
