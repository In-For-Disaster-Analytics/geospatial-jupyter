# Geospatial Analysis Application   

This application provides a Jupyter lab environment with essential geospatial analysis packages preinstalled in order to facilitate work in that space.  

Core Packages:

[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)
: The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.

[GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/stable/)
: GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing.

[h3-py](https://pypi.org/project/h3/)
: Ptyhon wrapper for Uber's [H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Geospatial Indexing System](https://h3geo.org/) in Python

[contextily](https://contextily.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
: contextily is a small Python 3 (3.9 and above) package to retrieve tile maps from the internet. It can add those tiles as basemap to matplotlib figures or write tile maps to disk into geospatial raster files. 

[geodatasets](https://geodatasets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
: The geodatasets contains an API on top of a JSON with metadata of externally hosted datasets containing geospatial information useful for illustrative and educational purposes.
